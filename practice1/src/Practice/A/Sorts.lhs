Can you use any of your sorting algorithms from parts (a)â€“(c) as the sorting method used in line 2 of RADIX-SORT, so that RADIX-SORT sorts n records with b-bit keys in O(bn) time? Explain how or why not.



Suppose that the n records have keys in the range from 1 to k. Show how to modify counting sort so that it sorts the records in place in O(n+k) time. You may use O(k) storage outside the input array. Is your algorithm stable? (Hint: How would you do it for k = 3?)
